Hello, my name is Kyle!

Programming, electronics, and technology are my passion.

I am passionate about experimenting and learning new things regularly, be it a new framework, a new language, or a new way to apply knowledge to my projects.
Over the years, I have gained experience with such things as: web development, game design and development, desktop application, mobile, and a hint of embedded development.

The languages I have worked with are, but not limited to:
C#, C/C++, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Python, Ruby, Lua, Bash, Powershell, Java, and some assembly/esoteric languages.

Besides programming, there's other hobbies that fill my never ending desire to create.
I make use of additive manufacturing by using CAD in order to create functional components through 3D printing. Operating 3D printers allow me to continue learning about mechanical engineering as a hobby.

I'm always looking forward to learning new traits and abilities that will further my skill set.

The best way to contact me is through my email or this profile.
